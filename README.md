# Programming in Java - Coursework 3 - Contact Manager
Note about ContactManagerImpl - addMeetingNotes(int id, String text)
* If using addMeetingNotes on a PastMeeting which already has notes, even though the specification doesn't state specifically what to do in this case, I have opted to add the notes the user provides to the end of the old notes, rather than overwriting the old notes.
